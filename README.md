# Login-and-Signup-form
- Created a Login and Signup form on a single webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Implemented two clickable links ("Sign In" and "Sign Up") which toggle display of respective forms without page reload.

- Used CSS z-index property to overlay and display one form at a time on the same page.

- Incorporated smooth show/hide functionality so clicking on a link displays the corresponding form.

- Added a close (cross) button on each form to hide it and return to the main view.

- Styled forms for a clean, modern UI ensuring usability and easy navigation.

- JavaScript handles user interactions for form toggling and close button functionality.

- Simplified user experience by avoiding multiple pages or popups, keeping the flow uninterrupted.

- Project helps practice front-end skills in form handling, event management, and layered UI design.
